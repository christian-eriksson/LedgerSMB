=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ledgersmb-admin [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command allows you to run commands against a postgresql database that
is created as a LedgerSMB company. These are the common commands:

=head1 COMMANDS

  user*      Create, delete, list users and change access rights

Additionally, the C<config*> command can be used to manage the content
of the configuration file.

* Command yet to be implemented

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Many commands take a C<db-uri> argument. This argument takes the following
form:

   dbname         # URL encoded database name ('my company' -> 'my%20company')
   [user@]host[:port]/dbname

The URI may be prefixed with the schema C<postgresql://>. Connection parameters
such as TLS requirement, may be appended as query parameters:

   dbname?ssl=true

Missing parts of the URI are resolved against any defaults provided in the
configuration files. (See the L</CONFIGURATION> section below.)

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --help

Prints this help output

=head2 --version

Prints short message with version output

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration is read from the first file that exists, iterating over

    $HOME/.ledgersmb-admin.conf
    /usr/local/etc/ledgersmb-admin.conf
    /etc/ledgersmb-admin.conf

If no configuration file is found, or the configuration file doesn't specify
the all connection parameters, PostgreSQL's PG* environment variables provide
fallback values.

The configuration file format is YAML. The minimal configuration file specifies
the C<connect_data> key with C<username>, C<password> and C<company> keys,
e.g.:

   connect_data:
      username: postgres
      password: abc
      company: test

For more information on the configuration file and available configuration
keys, see the output of C<config help>.
